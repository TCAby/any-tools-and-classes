# any-tools-and-classes
In the developing process, I sometimes create tools for myself that can be "replicated" for more than one project.

## :clipboard: TCALog.php skills:
    Output the debugging information
        1) into developer's console in your browser (*2console methods)
        2) into local file on the server (*2file methods)
 All methods using as a static, so you don't need to create an object of the class; 
 just TCALog::send2console('any string') for example üòè
